# Alzheimer's Disease Research.

This repository contains the basic code and analysis for Alzheimer's disease research, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning using various algorithms.

## Dataset

The Alzheimer's dataset used in this project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Explored the dataset to gain insights into key features.
- Visualized demographic information, cognitive test scores, and other relevant data.
- Identified potential patterns or relationships within the dataset.

## Feature Engineering

- Performed feature engineering to prepare the data for machine learning models.
- Handled missing values.
- Created new features or transformed existing ones to improve model performance.

## Machine Learning Models

Implemented and evaluated the following machine learning algorithms:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- AutoML
- K-Means (for clustering, if applicable)

## Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using standard classification metrics, including:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC curves
